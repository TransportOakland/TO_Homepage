		<div class="sixteen columns question">
			<p>Dear Councilmember [_____]</p>
			<p>My name is [_____] and I am a voter in District [_____]. I am writing to you because the Council President's budget proposes a $750,000 reduction for the new Oakland Department of Transportation (DOT) compared to the Mayor's original Budget. I urge your support to preserve the full $2.25M in Measure BB funds proposed to establish a DOT in the biennial budget for three reasons.</p>
			<p>The current rate of transportation funding spend-down and project delivery in Oakland is unacceptable. I voted for Measure BB because I want transformational changes to Oakland’s transportation system, including increased transparency, accountability, and stronger project delivery that a new DOT can bring. With new Measure BB funding available for much-needed repaving, Oakland needs a more efficient project development and delivery system to spend these new resources efficiently, bringing improvements in our District and around the City. Our current 85-year repaving schedule clearly doesn't cut it.</p>
			<p>Oakland is long overdue for essential roles focused on transportation equity, constituent service, and transit coordination. New DOT staff should provide an equity and universal accessibility lens to transportation improvements, increase responsiveness to neighborhood requests, and interface with transit providers to ensure smooth delivery of projects like East Bay BRT. These roles are lacking at Oakland Public Works and cannot merely be transferred to the new DOT without additional staffing.</p>
			<p>We risk missing out on 80% of the new Measure BB funds. Measure BB funds available to Oakland include “pass-through” funds that come directly to the City every month, but also discretionary funds that are administered by the Alameda County Transportation Commission. Starting this year, Oakland will need to compete with other jurisdictions to get our fair share of these additional funds. Without adequate staff to prepare projects for these competitive discretionary funds, Oakland risks losing out on 80% of the transportation funds available through Measure BB. Proper funding and staffing of the DOT will pay for itself through the tens of millions of dollars available in Measure BB funds.</p>
			<p>For all these reasons, I urge you to support the funding the Oakland DOT at the originally proposed $2.25 million.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p>[Your name]</p>

			<h3 align="center">Oakland needs a Department of Transportation</h3>
			<p class="lead">By passing Measure BB by 75% last fall, Oakland voters made clear they want to see transportation improved. But currently, transportation planning falls to a subset of a city agency that also oversees turf mowing, recycling, and creek restoration. It’s time to strategically reconsider how transportation projects are developed and delivered in Oakland. </p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns question">
			<i class="icon-comments"></i>
			<h5>What is Oakland losing out on by not having a DOT?</h5>
			<p>PROJECTS = FUNDING = IMPLEMENTED PROJECTS With no staff dedicated to developing new transportation projects, Oakland has no project pipeline. Even though Oakland competes excellently on many discretionary funding qualifications, it just isn't as competitive as it should be for regional, state, and federal grant funding because there are no projects to fund.</p>
			<p>COORDINATION - Oakland’s transit agency partners don’t have clear points of contact within our city, delaying simple improvements like relocating bus stops and complicating larger capital projects like International BRT. Creating a DOT would designate and authorize specific staff to represent Oakland in interagency efforts.</p>
			<p>RESPONSIVENESS - DOTs commonly assign liaisons to each district. These staff direct small improvements (like responding to requests for new crosswalks), and coordinate larger district-level plans (such as identifying, coordinating grant funding for, and implementing key projects in each district).</p>
			<p>LEADERSHIP - To attract a truly innovative transportation leader, Oakland needs to create a department director position that is empowered to lead the development and implementation of transportation improvements.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sixteen columns question">
			<i class="icon-comments"></i>
			<h5>Do other cities have DOTs?</h5>
			<p>Innovative US cities both large and Oakland-sized have city Departments of Transportation that are set up to think strategically about municipal transportation project development and delivery and to provide the transportation leadership that Oakland is currently lacking.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sixteen columns question">
			<i class="icon-comments"></i>
			<h5>How much will this cost?</h5>
			<p>Let's be clear: we aren't advocating that funds be diverted from other city services. Strategic reorganization of existing staff and Measure BB-funded positions--moneys that must be spent on transportation--would enable an Oakland DOT to deliver Measure BB projects on time and to develop a rich pipeline of innovative projects to secure future discretionary funding. By simply reallocating existing resources, a DOT could not only be budget-netural now but pay for itself in the future.</p>

			<h3 align="center">What is Great Transportation?</h3>
			<p class="lead">Great transportation means having safe and attractive choices to navigate Oakland, whether you are driving, taking the bus or BART, walking, or riding a bicycle. Cities around the world have started to experiment with new ways of designing streets to provide these choices. Low-cost treatments using paint, green planters, and seating can transform a street into a different and better place in as quickly as one to two years in parallel to longer term major capital investments such as BART extensions.</p>

			<p class="lead">Great transportation reflects the community it exists in, making it a key part of Oakland’s infrastructure and resulting in measurable benefits including increased retail sales, improved public health through physical activity, reduced crime, improved air quality, and greater ownership of our streets.</p>

			<h3 align="center">Oakland’s Streets are a Precious and Underutilized Public Resource</h3>
			<p class="lead">In Oakland, many of our streets were designed in a different era with different needs and priorities. Particularly in downtown, Oakland streets are imbalanced with more concrete dedicated to cars than is (or will be) necessary.  In the last ten years, traffic in downtown Oakland has actually decreased by 25%, even as more than 10,000 more residents have moved into the city.</p>
			<p class="lead">Now is an exciting time for local policy-makers to provide transportation leadership. Several near-term opportunities exist to provide noticeable and lasting benefit to the city. We are proposing that elected leaders endorse the following 3-part platform. Funding for these priorities is already available with no additional taxes or fees needed, especially after Alameda Measure BB passed in the November election.</p>

			<p>In Oakland, many of our streets were designed in a different era with different needs and priorities. Many streets are imbalanced with more concrete dedicated to cars than is (or will be) necessary.. Downtown Oakland is comprised of many one-way three- and four-lane streets that are never even close to full. In the last ten years, traffic in downtown Oakland has actually decreased by about 25%, even as more than 10,000 more residents have moved into the city.</p>
